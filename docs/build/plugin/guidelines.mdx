# Plugin creation guidelines

One of the advantages of Massa Station is that plugins can be developed in any programming language. But in order for modules to work on the Massa Station, they must first respect a certain number of guidelines.

## Tech Stack

You can developp a plugin in any wanted language. The easiest way is to use go with the the [plugin hello-world](https://github.com/massalabs/station-massa-hello-world) hook to register the plugin.

### Develop a plugin in go

To do so once you created a new plugin, you can add the following code to your main.go file to register the plugin to the Massa Station:

```go
	listener, err := server.HTTPListener()
	if err != nil {
		panic(err)
	}

	plugin.RegisterPlugin(listener)
```

### Develop a plugin in any other language

Your plugin will need to call **the Register Endpoint** to be compatible with Massa Station: The plugin should be able to call the `register` endpoint in Massastation defined [here](https://github.com/massalabs/station/blob/v0.2.5/api/swagger/server/restapi/resource/swagger.yml#L481C28-L481C28).

In other words, the plugin should be able to call the following endpoint :

- **Endpoint:** `/plugin-manager/register`
- **Method:** POST
- **Description:** Register a plugin. Used by plugins to register themselves to the plugin manager.
- **Operation ID:** `pluginManagerRegister`
- **Parameters:**
  - `body` (Request Body, required): The request body containing the following properties:
    - `id` (string, required): Plugin identifier.
    - `url` (string, required): URL authority to use for connecting to the plugin.

## Artifact requirements

To be compatible with Massa Station, the plugin artifact must contain the following files :

### Logo

There must be a plugin logo in the artifact. it must be a [valid image file](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Media/Formats/Image_types)

### Module manifest

The manifest will provide the necessary information to the Massa Station to display the plugin in the UI. It must be a `manifest.json` file at the root of the artifact. It must contain the following properties :

| Fields      | Description                   | Format | Specifications    |
| ----------- | ----------------------------- | ------ | ----------------- |
| Author      | Module author name            | text   | 30 characters max |
| Name        | Module name                   | text   | 30 characters max |
| Description | Module short description text | text   | 80 characters max |
| Logo        | Module logo file name         | text   | 40px x 40px max   |
| Home        | URL to module home page       | URL    | N/A               |
| Version     | Module version                | semver | XX.XX.XX          |
| APIspec     | api specifications            | text   | N/A               |

> example :
>
> ```json
> {
>   "author": "Massa Labs",
>   "name": "hello-world",
>   "description": "hello world plugin",
>   "logo": "hello_world.svg",
>   "home": "",
>   "version": "0.0.6",
>   "apispec": ""
> }
> ```
